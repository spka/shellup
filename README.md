# Shellup üêö‚òùÔ∏è
_Small zsh script to trigger (fzf) history._

## Usecase

I like the default shell history ux, but after 5 or so commands i lose track. Time to press `ctrl + R`, but im lazy...

## Requires fzf

[fzf - a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Install Zsh

1. Clone this repository somewhere on your machine. This guide will assume `~/.zsh/shellup`.

    ```

2. Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

    ```sh
